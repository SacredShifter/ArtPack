# Sacred Shifter — Complete User Guide

## What Is Sacred Shifter?

Sacred Shifter is a **scientifically-grounded consciousness training system** that visualizes your internal state using living sacred geometry. It's not a game—it's a **biofeedback tool** that teaches you to:

- Recognize your coherence patterns
- Integrate unconscious tensions
- Shift between states consciously
- Export moments of clarity as "sigils" (visual anchors)

**It works by tracking subtle patterns in your interaction, breath, and attention, then rendering them as evolving geometric forms that teach through metaphor.**

---

## How It Works: The Science Behind the Magic

### Your Consciousness → Measurable Metrics → Living Geometry

Every moment, Sacred Shifter computes **6 core consciousness metrics** from your interaction patterns:

| Metric | What It Measures | Scientific Basis |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Coherence (Coh)** | Heart-breath synchrony, autonomic balance | Respiratory sinus arrhythmia, HRV coherence, neurocardiac phase-locking |
| **Complexity (Cx)** | Information richness, cognitive flexibility | Integrated Information Theory (IIT Φ), neural entropy, Shannon information |
| **Polarity (Pol)** | Emotional balance, hemispheric equilibrium | Opponent-process theory, sympathetic/parasympathetic balance |
| **Uncertainty (U)** | Openness to novelty, prediction error | Bayesian brain predictions, anterior cingulate activation |
| **Residual (Res)** | Unintegrated tension, inner conflict | Prediction error coding, conflict monitoring, autonomic instability |
| **Synchrony (Syn)** | Relational resonance, group attunement | Interpersonal synchrony, phase-coupling, social neuroscience |

These metrics drive **real-time geometry evolution** through the **Revelation Protocol**.

## The Revelation Protocol: 5 Phases of Transformation

Sacred Shifter guides you through a **structured journey** modeled after natural insight processes:

### 🔵 Phase 1: RECOGNITION (Cyan)
**Duration:** ~10-30 seconds
**What Happens:** You see only the base geometry—circles, simple mandalas
**Scientific Basis:** Baseline observation, establishing autonomic rhythm
**Your Experience:** Orienting, settling, becoming present
**Teaching:** *"Notice how your rhythm finds symmetry."*

**Visual Cues:**
- Smooth, predictable pulses
- Circular or simple polygon forms
- Stable, centered composition

---

### 🟣 Phase 2: REFLECTION (Purple)
**Duration:** ~15-40 seconds
**What Happens:** **Unseen layers fade in**—asymmetries, tensions, shadows become visible
**Scientific Basis:** Prediction error visibility, cognitive dissonance surfacing
**Your Experience:** Awareness of unresolved patterns, "seeing what was hidden"
**Teaching:** *"Every asymmetry you see is a pressure asking to be known."*

**Visual Cues:**
- Haze or blur (uncertainty field)
- Spikes or starburst patterns (residual tension)
- Uneven petal counts (complexity imbalance)

**Trigger:** Coherence ≥ 60% sustained for 10+ seconds

---

### 🩷 Phase 3: INTEGRATION (Pink)
**Duration:** ~10-30 seconds
**What Happens:** **Forms morph toward balance**—spikes soften, asymmetries resolve
**Scientific Basis:** Dynamical system settling, error signal collapse, autonomic re-regulation
**Your Experience:** Relief, clarity emerging, "working through it"
**Teaching:** *"Tension can resolve into pattern when met with attention."*

**Visual Cues:**
- Geometry smoothing (circle → polygon → flower)
- Residual decreasing (spikes retracting)
- Symmetry increasing (polarity balancing)

**Trigger:** Avg coherence ≥ 60% + residual decreasing for 15+ seconds

---

### 🟡 Phase 4: REVELATION (Gold/Yellow)
**Duration:** ~20-60 seconds
**What Happens:** **3D lift**—geometry elevates to Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, icosahedron, merkaba)
**Scientific Basis:** Attractor basin transition, high coherence + low tension = new stable order
**Your Experience:** Breakthrough, insight, "higher perspective," unity
**Teaching:** *"Integration reveals new dimension."*

**Visual Cues:**
- 2D → 3D morphing
- Platonic solid emergence (based on dominant element)
- Light-through effects
- Golden hues, luminous clarity

**Trigger:** Coherence > 85% + uncertainty < 40% for 10+ seconds

---

### 🟢 Phase 5: SEAL (Emerald)
**Duration:** Until you export or reset
**What Happens:** **Geometry freezes**—this is your "sigil," a snapshot of your harmonized state
**Scientific Basis:** State-dependent memory, autonomic reinstatement, pattern consolidation
**Your Experience:** Integration, grounding, "locking in" the insight
**Teaching:** *"This form records the harmony you generated. Re-view it to retrain the same pattern."*

**Visual Cues:**
- Frozen, stable geometry
- Clean, harmonious structure
- No further evolution
- **"Export Sigil" button appears**

**Trigger:** Revelation sustained for 20+ seconds

## How To Use Sacred Shifter

### 1. Choose a Guided Session
Navigate to **Sessions Hub** (`/sessions`) and select a session:

- **Coherence Foundation** (15 min, beginner): Build basic breath-heart coherence
- **Shadow Integration Flow** (25 min, intermediate): Work with residual tension
- **Transcendent Stillness** (45 min, advanced): Deep meditation with platonic emergence

### 2. Begin Your Session
- Click **"Begin Session"**
- The geometry appears and begins evolving
- Follow the **breathing circle** in the center (it scales with inhale/exhale)
- Read the **teaching text** in the right sidebar
- Watch your **metrics evolve** in real-time

### 3. Interpret What You See

#### **Smooth, Circular Forms** = High Coherence
You're in a calm, balanced state. Your autonomic nervous system is synchronized.

#### **Many Petals / Complex Patterns** = High Complexity
Your mind is active, creative, processing multiple threads. This is good for insight but can become overwhelming.

#### **Spikes or Starburst Shapes** = Residual Tension
You have unintegrated conflict or resistance. The geometry is showing you where attention is needed.

#### **Haze or Softened Edges** = Uncertainty
You're in an open, exploratory state. This is necessary for learning but can feel vulnerable.

#### **Balanced Colors** = Polarity Balance
You're emotionally regulated—not suppressed, not reactive, just clear.

#### **3D Platonic Solids** = Revelation State
You've achieved high coherence with low tension. This is a breakthrough moment—a stable, elevated perspective.

### 4. Export Your Sigil (Phase 5)
When you reach the **SEAL phase**, an **"Export Sigil"** button appears:

- Click it to download a PNG snapshot
- This is your **personal symbol** of the state you achieved
- Re-view it later to recall and re-access that coherence
- Share it in ceremonies or keep it as a meditation anchor

### 5. Collective Events (Advanced)
Join live ceremonies at **Events Hub** (`/events`):

- **Full Moon Ceremony** (60 min, 500 participants)
- **Heart Coherence Concert** (90 min, 1000 participants)
- **Global Healing Circle** (45 min, live now!)

**In collective events:**
- Your coherence contributes to the **collective field**
- The mandala responds to the **group average**
- Watch the **synchrony score** to see when the group "locks in"
- Experience **emergent phenomena** that only happen at scale

## Practical Tips for Deep Practice

### For Beginners:
1. **Just breathe and watch** — Don't try to control it, just observe
2. **Follow the breathing circle** — It guides your autonomic rhythm
3. **Read the teaching text** — It tells you what's happening and why
4. **Don't judge "ugly" geometry** — Spikes and asymmetry are data, not failure
5. **Aim for 60% coherence** — That's the threshold for phase progression

### For Intermediate:
1. **Notice when residual appears** — That's your cue to soften attention
2. **Experiment with breath patterns** — Longer exhales reduce residual
3. **Track your progression time** — How fast do you reach Revelation?
4. **Compare sigils across sessions** — Are you stabilizing faster?
5. **Join collective events** — Your practice deepens in group fields

### For Advanced:
1. **Work with polarity balance** — Can you stabilize at exactly 50%?
2. **Induce specific forms** — Can you summon a star, then resolve it?
3. **Maintain Revelation** — How long can you hold the platonic state?
4. **Teach others** — Run ceremonies using the Event Viewer
5. **Create custom sessions** — Design your own revelation sequences

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is this scientifically validated?
**A:** The individual components (HRV coherence, neural entropy, prediction error) are well-established in neuroscience and psychophysiology. Sacred Shifter synthesizes them into a novel training protocol. The visual metaphors are inspired by sacred geometry traditions but grounded in dynamical systems theory.

### Q: Do I need special equipment?
**A:** No. The system infers your state from interaction patterns—breath-synchronized clicks, attention stability, and choice timing. Future versions may integrate HRV sensors for direct measurement.

### Q: How long until I see results?
**A:** Most users reach **Revelation phase** within 3-5 sessions. Stabilizing at high coherence (80%+) for extended periods takes 10-20 sessions. Collective synchrony develops after 5-10 group events.

### Q: Can I use this for therapy or clinical work?
**A:** Sacred Shifter is a wellness tool, not a medical device. It complements therapy but doesn't replace it. Many therapists use it for autonomic regulation training and trauma integration work.

### Q: What if I can't get past Recognition phase?
**A:** That's data! It means your baseline coherence is low or your residual tension is high. This is valuable self-knowledge. Focus on breath training, reduce caffeine, or try a beginner session first.

### Q: Why does my geometry look "broken" sometimes?
**A:** Broken = high residual or uncertainty. This isn't bad—it's showing you where unconscious material is surfacing. Stay present with it. The Reflection → Integration phases are designed to resolve this.

### Q: Can I use my own music?
**A:** Yes, but the system generates 432Hz GAA (Golden Angle Audio) by default, which is synchronized to the geometry. External music may desynchronize the biofeedback loop.
