# Sacred Shifter — Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 What Am I Looking At?

| **What You See** | **What It Means** | **What To Do** |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Smooth, circular forms** | High coherence - you're calm and centered | Maintain your rhythm, enjoy the flow |
| **Many petals (6-12)** | High complexity - active, creative mind | Good for insight, but monitor if overwhelming |
| **Few petals (3-4)** | Low complexity - simple, focused state | Good for concentration |
| **Spikes / starburst** | Residual tension - unresolved conflict | Soften attention, longer exhales |
| **Haze / soft edges** | Uncertainty - openness to novelty | Normal for learning, embrace not-knowing |
| **Bright colors, even symmetry** | Balanced polarity - emotional equilibrium | You're integrated, keep going |
| **Geometry lifting to 3D** | Revelation phase - breakthrough incoming | Witness without attachment |
| **Frozen mandala** | Seal phase - integration complete | Export your sigil, reflect on the journey |

## 📊 Metrics Cheat Sheet

| **Metric** | **0-30%** | **30-60%** | **60-85%** | **85-100%** |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Coh** (Coherence) | Scattered, reactive | Functional | Calm, centered | Deep flow, unity |
| **Cx** (Complexity) | Rigid, narrow | Moderate flexibility | Rich insights | Creative surge |
| **Pol** (Polarity) | Extreme bias | Some imbalance | Balanced | Perfect equilibrium |
| **U** (Uncertainty) | Over-confident | Clear models | Healthy openness | Exploratory, vulnerable |
| **Res** (Residual) | Resolved | Minor tension | Active processing | High conflict |
| **Syn** (Synchrony) | Isolated | Some connection | Attuned | Deep unity |

## 🌀 Form Evolution Path

```
🔵 Circle (Unity)
    ↓ Complexity increases
🔷 Polygon (Structure)
    ↓ Coherence + Complexity increase
🌸 Flower (Harmony)
    ↓ Residual spike
⭐ Star (Tension)
    ↓ Coherence > 85% + Uncertainty < 40%
💎 Platonic Solid (Revelation)
    ↓ Coherence > 90% + Polarity balanced
✨ Merkaba (Transcendence)
```

## 🎨 Phase Colors & Meanings

| **Phase** | **Color** | **Duration** | **Experience** |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Recognition** | 🔵 Cyan | ~10-30s | Observing, settling |
| **Reflection** | 🟣 Purple | ~15-40s | Seeing shadows, tensions |
| **Integration** | 🩷 Pink | ~10-30s | Resolving, morphing |
| **Revelation** | 🟡 Gold | ~20-60s | Breakthrough, insight |
| **Seal** | 🟢 Emerald | Until export | Integration complete |

## 🧘 Quick Tips by Experience Level

### Beginner
- Follow the breathing circle
- Aim for 60% coherence
- Don't judge "ugly" geometry
- Read teaching text carefully
- Export your first sigil

### Intermediate
- Notice when residual appears
- Experiment with breath patterns
- Track progression time
- Join collective events
- Compare sigils across sessions

### Advanced
- Work with polarity balance
- Induce specific forms intentionally
- Maintain Revelation phase
- Teach others / host ceremonies
- Create custom sessions

## 🚀 Session Workflow

1. **Choose Session** → Sessions Hub
2. **Press Begin** → Watch geometry appear
3. **Follow Breath** → Inhale/exhale with circle
4. **Read Teaching** → Right sidebar guidance
5. **Watch Metrics** → Coherence, complexity bars
6. **Progress Phases** → Recognition → Seal
7. **Export Sigil** → Click button in Seal phase
8. **Reflect** → What did the form teach you?

## 🌍 Collective Events

**Join live ceremonies at Events Hub:**
- Your coherence contributes to group field
- Watch synchrony score for group lock-in
- Experience emergence at scale
- Share sigils with community

**Live Event Indicators:**
- 🟢 Green pulse = LIVE NOW
- Participant count updating
- Collective coherence meter
- Synchrony score rising

## 🔬 Scientific Quick Facts

| **Variable** | **Measures** | **Science** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Coh** | Heart-breath sync | HRV coherence, RSA |
| **Cx** | Info richness | IIT Φ, neural entropy |
| **Pol** | Emotional balance | Hemispheric symmetry, ANS balance |
| **U** | Prediction error | Bayesian brain, ACC activation |
| **Res** | Unintegrated tension | Conflict monitoring, error signals |
| **Syn** | Relational resonance | Interpersonal phase-locking |

---

## 🎯 Common Goals

| **Goal** | **Target Metrics** | **Session Type** |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Calm anxiety | Coh > 70%, Res < 30% | Coherence Foundation |
| Boost creativity | Cx > 60%, U > 50% | Shadow Integration |
| Emotional balance | Pol = 45-55% | Any session |
| Deep meditation | Coh > 85%, Res < 20% | Transcendent Stillness |
| Group connection | Syn > 70% | Collective Events |

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

| **Problem** | **Likely Cause** | **Solution** |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Stuck in Recognition | Low baseline coherence | Focus on breath, reduce caffeine |
| Geometry feels chaotic | High complexity, high residual | Simplify attention, longer exhales |
| Never reach Revelation | Not sustaining 85% Coh | Practice daily, 10-20 sessions needed |
| Sigil export fails | Browser issue | Try different browser, check permissions |
| Collective event laggy | Network or device | Close other tabs, refresh page |

## 💡 Remember

**You are not trying to "win" or achieve perfect geometry.**

**You're learning to observe, integrate, and shift with awareness.**

**The geometry is your teacher.**

**Your sigil is your map back to clarity.**

🌌 **May your forms reveal your truth.** ✨
