## 🔬 Scientific Integration

### Biometric Optimization

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**
- Low HRV → Eternal Void (calming, parasympathetic)
- Medium HRV → Golden Ratio or Flower of Life (balancing)
- High HRV → Consciousness Fractal (can handle complexity)

**Breath Rate**
- < 6 breaths/min → Any pack (optimal)
- 6-12 breaths/min → Golden Ratio, Flower of Life
- > 12 breaths/min → Eternal Void (calming first)

**EEG Bands**
- High Gamma (>40Hz) → Consciousness Fractal (mystical experiences)
- Beta (13-30Hz) → Golden Ratio (focus)
- Alpha (8-12Hz) → Flower of Life (relaxed awareness)
- Theta (4-8Hz) → Any pack (theta optimal for all)
- Delta (<4Hz) → Eternal Void (deep states)

### Neuroscience Notes

**Default Mode Network (DMN)**
- All packs can decrease DMN activity
- Eternal Void: Maximum DMN suppression
- Consciousness Fractal: DMN dissolution + pattern recognition network activation

**Salience Network**
- Golden Ratio: Enhances salience detection
- Flower of Life: Balances salience across multiple objects

**Visual Cortex**
- All packs strongly activate V1-V5
- Consciousness Fractal: Maximum complexity = maximum activation
- Flower of Life: Symmetry detection specialized areas

## 📚 Theoretical Foundations

### Sacred Geometry
- **Flower of Life**: Contains all Platonic solids, basis of creation
- **Golden Ratio**: Divine proportion, natural growth pattern
- **Fractals**: Self-similarity across scales, consciousness structure

### Hermetic Principles
1. **Mentalism**: "All is Mind" → visualized in Consciousness Fractal
2. **Correspondence**: "As above, so below" → Golden Ratio universality
3. **Vibration**: "Nothing rests" → all packs are animated
4. **Polarity**: "Opposites are identical" → Eternal Void (black = white)
5. **Rhythm**: "Flow and reflow" → breath synchronization
6. **Cause & Effect**: Coherence affects visuals
7. **Gender**: "Generation on all planes" → Flower of Life (creation)
