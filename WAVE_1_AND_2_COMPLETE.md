### Pack 5: Synaptic Field ⚡
**Location**: `/artpacks/theunseen/SynapticField/`

**The Cosmic Brain**

Visual Features:
- 24 dynamic neural nodes
- Electrical connections between nodes
- Traveling pulses along synaptic pathways
- Ambient field activity
- Symmetry emerges from coherence

Metrics Reactivity:

## ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY

All 6 packs follow the **exact same structure**:

### Standard Uniforms
```javascript
{
  uTime, uResolution, uCoherence,
  uStillness, uGain, uPhase, uSeed
}
```

### Standard Interface
```javascript
export function register(engine) {
  engine.registerMaterial(name, material);
  engine.registerNode(name, factory);
  engine.setParamMapper((seed, coherence) => {...});
  engine.onFrame((deltaTime, t, params) => {...});
  engine.defineSafetyCaps({...});
}
```

### Shared Core Utilities
All packs have access to:
- `noise.glsl.ts` (Simplex, FBM, turbulence)
- `flow.glsl.ts` (Curl, vortex, drift)
- `geometry.glsl.ts` (Sacred geometry primitives)
- `fractal.glsl.ts` (Mandelbrot, Julia)
